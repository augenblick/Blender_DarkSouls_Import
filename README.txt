Create new directory "Dark_Souls_Importer" directory in the the Blender <2.8x>\<2.8x>\scripts\addons directory and place all contents there.

In Blender, go to Edit > Preference > Add-ons and enable the "Dark Souls Importer" add-on.

Expand the add-on info and set preferences for the three following items:
	- Directory containing .tpf files: The directory containing .tpf files in the unpacked Dark Souls data
	- Directory in which to store .dds files: Create a new directory or use an existing directory.  This is where the extracted .dds texture files will be stored.
	- Path to 'Missing Texture' file: A path to a custom texture that will be used in cases where the add-on is unable to extract or find the required textures.  (A simple UV grid exported from Blender is a good option.)

This add-on is a work in progress!

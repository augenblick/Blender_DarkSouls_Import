1)   In Blender, visit the Edit > Preferences > Add-ons menu.  From there, select "Install" and navigate to the downloaded zip file (Blender will install the add-on directly from the zipped file-- no need to unzip first).

2)   The add-on should then appear in the Add-ons menu-- Be sure to enable it!

3)   After enabling, be sure to expand the add-on info and set the Add-on preferences for the three following items:
	- .tpf filepath: The directory containing .tpf files in the unpacked Dark Souls data
	- .dds filepath: Create a new directory or use an existing directory.  This is where the extracted .dds texture files will be stored.
	- 'Missing Texture' filepath: A path to a custom texture that will be used in cases where the add-on is unable to extract or find the required textures.  This can be any image file of your choosing(A simple UV grid exported from Blender is a good option.)


==========================================
This add-on is a work in progress!
